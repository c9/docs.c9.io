# Tab Functions

Cloud9 IDE offers advanced tab features to make working with multiple files easy. By right-clicking on any tab, you'll open up the tab context menu:

These feature include:

* **Reveal in File Tree**: opens the current file in the Project Files tree
* **Close Tab**: closes the current tab
* **Close All Tabs**: closes all the opened files
* **Close All But Current Tab**: closes all the opened files, except the current one
* **Close Tabs to the Right/Left**: closes all opened tabs to the right (or left) of the current one 
* **File Revision History...**: launches [the revisions](./revisions.html) panel


To the left of the tab menu is another button that offers additional functions for tab navigation:

Among these is the ability to use tab sessions.
 
## Tab Sessions 

Tab sessions is a unique feature that is useful when dealing with projects that involve juggling between many tabs. Essentially, tab sessions lets you save the current state of the tabs. You can close your workspace, switch to a different branch, and instantly reload your previously opened files. You'll no longer need to work with opening and closing multiple files.

Here's a video highlighting its use:

To use tab sessions, select **Save Tab Sessions** from the tab button menu. Give it a unique name. When you're ready to restore your tab sessions, just select **Load Tab Sessions**. 

If you find that you've got too many tab sessions defined, you can always choose to delete them from the same tab menu.
