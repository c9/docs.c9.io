# The Project Bar

The project bar is located towards the left of the Cloud9 IDE: ![The Project Bar](./resources/images/project_bar.png)<197, 26>

The buttons in the project bar allow you to reveal and hide panels for the IDE. In more detail:

* Pressing on the Cloud9 icon collapses the panel area
* **Project Files** shows your workspace's directory structure. You can view all your files here. Right-clicking within this panel reveals a drop-down menu with additional options, such as the ability to rename files or create new directories.
* **Active Files** lists your files that are currently open.
* **Run & Debug** lets you run and debug your code live, in the browser. For more information, see [the section on "Running and Debugging Your Code"](./running_and_debugging_code.html).
* **Deploy** allows you to deploy to a variety of services. For more information, see [the section on "Deploying Your Code"](./deploying_code.html).
* **Preferences** lets you change the behavior of the editor. The Preferences documentation is provided [on its own page](ide_preferences.html).

Clicking on any button expands its menu. Clicking on an expanded menu causes it to collapse, which gives you more room in the IDE to work with.
