## The Dashboard

After you have logged into Cloud9, you are placed into your account's dashboard. From here, you can edit your profile and manage workspaces you have access to.

In the top-left corner of the dashboard, your username is displayed. Within the user context, you can view your user profile by clicking on **Your Account**:

The user profile contains:

* Your recent activities, including a list of actions you have recently performed, such as cloning, opening, and deleting projects
* Your add-on services, which you've integrated into Cloud9. Currently, these are [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org).
* Your account settings, where you're given the following choices:
    * Change your password
    * Change your email
    * Show your SSH key
    * Upgrade to premium (or, downgrade from it)
    * Enter a promotion code
    * Delete your account
    

The gravatar that is used for your profile is handled by [gravatar.com](http://www.gravatar.com. If you don't have a gravatar yet, Cloud9 IDE uses its default.

In the left panel, you'll find a list of various projects associated with your account. These are:  

* My Projects: these are projects you've created or cloned, and own
* Shared With Me: these are projects shared with you by other Cloud9 users
* Recently Visited: these are projects you've seen lately
* Projects on GitHub: a list of your uncloned public and private GitHub projects
* Projects on Bitbucket: a list of your uncloned public and private Bitbucket projects

Clicking on the ![Project Add Icon](./icons/workspacePlusIcon.png) next to **MY PROJECTS** lets you:

* Create a new project
* Clone from URL

For more information on creating new projects, see [this article](./creating_new_workspace.html).

You can always filter your project list by entering text in the text bar to find matching projects. If you need to update the list, click the refresh icon at the bottom of the panel: ![Refresh projects button](./icons/refreshProjects.png)
