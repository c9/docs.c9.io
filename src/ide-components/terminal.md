# Terminal

The terminal provides you with a TTY interface for _direct access_ to the machine that Cloud9 is running on. If you're [running your own workspace](./run_your_own_workspace.html), this is the server you've SSH'ed into. If you're using the hosted Cloud9 platform, this is the server your code runs on. 

Warning: While certain operations, like `sudo`, are restricted, you **can** completely destroy your workspace, by doing something like `rm -rf`.  Use your power wisely!

To create a new terminal, go to [[menu: View, Terminals, New Terminal]], or simply type [[keys: Alt-T]] on the keyboard. The terminal has the following capabilities:

* Perform all Unix commands
* You can create more than one instance of a terminal (by just creating a new tab)
* The terminal allows for path autocompletion by hitting [[keys: Tab]]
