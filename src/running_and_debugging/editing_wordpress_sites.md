Did you know that you can use Cloud9 IDE to work on your WordPress website? It's true, and incredibly easy. You can't edit your posts on WordPress using Cloud9, since they are stored in a database on your server. But you can edit pretty much every other aspect of your site.

To start, you'll need to [create a new FTP project](./ftp_workspaces.html). After that, enter your _wp-content_ folder, find the theme you're using on your website, and start editing its style.

Thanks to [the preview button](./ide_overview.html#previewButton) in the menu bar, you can also witness your changes as they happen, before committing them to your server.
