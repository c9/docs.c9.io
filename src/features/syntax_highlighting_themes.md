# Syntax Higlighting and Themes

<!-- video  -->

Cloud9 IDE develops and builds on [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace), an editor for writing code online. Ace supports over two dozen different themes for highlighting your code, and any changes made to Ace are reflected back into Cloud9 IDE.

You can change your current theme by going to [[menu: View, Themes]], and selecting from one of the many options. By hovering over the menu items, you'll be able to get a preview of the theme. To activate a theme you like, just click on its name.

The IDE contains the following themes:

<div markdown="1" style="-moz-column-count: 2; -moz-column-gap: 20px; -webkit-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-gap: 20px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">
* Chrome
* Clouds
* Clouds Midnight
* Cobalt
* Crimson Editor
* Dawn
* Eclipse
* Idle Fingers
* Kr Theme
* Merbivore
* Merbivore Soft
* Mono Industrial
* Monokai
* Pastel On Dark
* Solarized Dark
* Solarized Light
* TextMate
* Tomorrow
* Tomorrow Night
* Tomorrow Night Blue
* Tomorrow Night Bright
* Tomorrow Night Eighties
* Twilight
* Vibrant Ink
</div>

By default, files are highlighted based on their file extension. You can change this by going to [[menu: View, Syntax]], and selecting a different context. This forces a single file to use a different highlighter.

We support highlighting for the following languages:

<div markdown="1" style="-moz-column-count: 2; -moz-column-gap: 20px; -webkit-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-gap: 20px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">
* CoffeeScript
* ColdFusion
* C#
* CSS
* Go
* Groovy
* haXe
* HTML
* C/C++
* Clojure
* Java
* JavaScript
* JSON
* LaTeX

* Liquid
* Lua
* Markdown
* OCaml

* Python
* Ruby

We are always adding new themes and new languages to support, so check the menu often! Since we use Ace to provide syntax highlighting, [feel free to log an issue there](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues?labels=mode-request&page=1&state=open) for new requests.
