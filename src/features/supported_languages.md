# Supported Languages and Themes

<!-- video  -->

Cloud9 IDE develops and builds on [Ace], an editor for writing code online. Ace supports over two dozen different themes for highlighting your code, and any changes made to Ace are reflected back into Cloud9 IDE.

You can change your current theme by going to **View | Themes**, and selecting from one of the many options. By hovering over the menu items, you'll be able to get a preview of the theme. To activate a theme you like, just click on its name.

The IDE contains the following themes:

<div markdown="1" style="-moz-column-count: 2; -moz-column-gap: 20px; -webkit-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-gap: 20px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">

By default, files are highlighted based on their file extension. You can change this by going to **View | Syntax**, and selecting a different context. This forces a single file to use a different highlighter.

We support highlighting for the following languages:

<div markdown="1" style="-moz-column-count: 2; -moz-column-gap: 20px; -webkit-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-gap: 20px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">
