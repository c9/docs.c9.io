This is the source documentation for the [Cloud9 IDE ](https://www.c9.io) User Documentation. 

The build system relies on the [Panda-Docs](https://github.com/gjtorikian/panda-docs) Node.js module.

# Creating a Build

First, check out this repository. Then, run

    npm install
    
to grab all the required dependencies.

To create a **development** build, open your command prompt and type:

    node build.js true

A development build differs in that it does not compress assets or add iframe headers and footers. To create a releasable build, just run the same command without any arguments:

	node build.js

# Deploy

The site https://docs.c9.io is deployed automatically whenever something is pushed to master.
